A preview deployment is being created automatically on Netlify.

**Preview URL**: Will be available once Netlify finishes building (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

**Note**: 
- ✅ Preview deployments are automatic (no approval needed)
- ⏳ Production deployment will happen automatically after this PR is merged to \`main\`
- 🔒 Only merged PRs deploy to production

**Status**: Netlify is building your preview...`
